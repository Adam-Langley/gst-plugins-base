Release notes for GStreamer Plugins 0.7.4 "For Great Justice"

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy to announce a new release in the 0.7.x
   development  series  of  the  GStreamer streaming-media framework. The
   goal  of  this  release  series  is to stabilize towards a 0.8 release
   series  which  will  be  part  of the GNOME 2.6 releases and hopefully
   eventually KDE 4.x.

   The  0.7 series is a development series and is aimed at developers. It
   is  NOT  API  or  ABI  compatible with the stable 0.6.x series or with
   other  releases in the series. This means you can not use this release
   to  upgrade  your  current  GStreamer  installation  and  expect  your
   GStreamer  applications  to  keep  working without a recompile. It is,
   however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.

Download

   You  find  source  releases  of  gst-plugins  in  the  [14]gst-plugins
   download directory.

GStreamer Homepage

   More    details    can    be   found   on   the   project's   website,
   [15]http://www.freedesktop.org/~gstreamer.

Support and Bugs

   We use Gnome's bugzilla for [16]bug reports and feature requests.

Developers

   CVS   is   hosted  on  cvs.freedesktop.org.  You  can  [17]browse  the
   gst-plugins repository. All code is in CVS and can be checked out from
   there.  Interested  developers  of  the  core  library,  plug-ins, and
   applications should subscribe to the gstreamer-devel list. If there is
   sufficient interest we will create more lists as necessary.

Applications

   As  mentioned  there are some changes in API/ABI between the 0.6.x and
   0.7.x  releases.  Many applications will probably be source compatible
   between  0.6.x.  and 0.7.x however. [18]Rhythmbox and [19]Sound Juicer
   for  instance  work very well when compiled on 0.7.x. GStreamer Player
   does  not  work  across  releases  however, so we will make a separate
   release of gst-player with the needed fixes for it to work with 0.7.x.
   This  release  contains the core fixes we were waiting for to port the
   player over so expect a gst-player release in the near future.
