                     GStreamer "Panic Room" 0.5.2 released

   The  GStreamer  team is happy to announce our final prerelease for the
   stable 0.6 series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.

   From  now  on,  GStreamer  will  follow a versioning scheme similar to
   kernel  and  GTK+/GLib  releases.  Odd  minor  numbers  (like for this
   release)  will be development releases. While GStreamer itself is very
   much  under development, during stable releases we will guarantee API-
   and  ABI-stability.  The point of this development release cycle is to
   support Gnome 2.1.x development.

   GStreamer     major-minor     series     versions    will    now    be
   parallel-installable.  Please  update  your  applications to check for
   gstreamer-0.5,   gstreamer-libs-0.5   and   gstreamer-play-0.5   using
   pkg-config.

   We are starting to have a really nice collection of applications under
   development using GStreamer. If you are looking for something specific

Updates and Enhancements

  Thread issues and GStreamer

   Many  of  GStreamers features relies heavily on threads. Unfortunately
   everything  is  not rosy in the Linux worlds of threads. If you have a
   glibc version installed compiled with i686 optimizations (which uses a
   different  codepath  than standard i386 glibc), there is a good chance
   you   will   experience   thread-related  crashes  in  gstreamer-based
   applications. There are a few workarounds to this available.
     * You can use an i386- or i586-optimized glibc package instead.
     * You  can  also  try running the gstreamer-based applications using
       the command-line option --gst-scheduler=opt, which invokes a newly
       created  scheduler  that  does  not use threads. This scheduler is
       very  new  however  so you might encounter other issues when using
       it.
       People  using the Red Hat beta Phoebe are recommended to update to
       glibc  from  Rawhide. This solves all thread issues, thanks to the
       new NTPL thread library that is included there.

Support and Bugs

   We  use  [4]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback &> feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is  [5]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
