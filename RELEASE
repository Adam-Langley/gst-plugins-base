                   GStreamer "Mother Theresa" 0.6.3 released

   The  GStreamer  team  is  proud  to announce an updated version in the
   ABI-stable 0.6.x series.

   At  this  point  in  time  GStreamer  is fully functional for creating
   audio-based   applications,   as   shown   by   applications  such  as
   gnome-sound-recorder,      [1]rhythmbox,      [2]sound-juicer      and
   nautilus-media.

   The  video part is known to be somewhat less functional than the audio
   part,  but  applications  such as [3]gst-player works very well, and a
   port of [4]Totem is in progress in GNOME CVS.

   We  will  also be releasing a development 0.7 release series, in which
   we  will  work  on  such  things  as the remaining issues, such as the
   interactivity  support  which is needed for DVD menus and SWF (Flash).
   This  means  developers working on apps needing these services can use
   the  0.7  series  for development and then enable 0.6 support as these
   additions  optionally  get  backported to 0.6 once they are stable and
   work well.

   The  GStreamer  applications we ship all check for both gstreamer-0.6,
   gstreamer-libs-0.6  and  gstreamer-play-0.6; if those aren't found the
   0.7  version  of those files are checked for. We suggest anyone making
   GStreamer-based apps do the same.

   We are starting to have a really nice collection of applications under
   development using GStreamer. If you are looking for something specific
   check out our [5]applications status page.

Support and Bugs

   We  use [24]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback &> feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is [25]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking  for  people  with access to FreeBSD, Solaris,
   HP-UX,  Irix  and  True64  that  would  be willing to try building and
   testing  GStreamer.  Patches  fixing  such problems are also more than
   welcome.
