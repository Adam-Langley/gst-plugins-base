                     GStreamer "Starfleet" 0.5.1 released

   Send a message out accross the sky,
   Alien raiders just passed Gemini,
   Who will come and save us now?
   Who can defend us from their power?
   GStreamer! GStreamer! GStreamer!
   
   Tell the people back at Earth Control,
   Send GStreamer legions to save our souls,
   always daring and couragous,
   ooh! only they can save us.
   GStreamer! GStreamer! GStreamer!
   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media  framework. This release has mainly focused
   on  code  clean-up  and  rounding out of the features. Large chunks of
   GStreamer are API stable at this point.

   This  is  a development release, in which we test several new features
   and  change  installs and break stuff ! Do not update unless you are a
   developer  or  willing to deal with issues that will crop up. You have
   been warned ;) 

   From  now  on,  GStreamer  will  follow a versioning scheme similar to
   kernel  and  GTK+/GLib  releases.  Odd  minor  numbers  (like for this
   release)  will be development releases. While GStreamer itself is very
   much  under development, during stable releases we will guarantee API-
   and  ABI-stability.  The point of this development release cycle is to
   support Gnome 2.1.x development.

   GStreamer     major-minor     series     versions    will    now    be
   parallel-installable.  Please  update  your  applications to check for
   gstreamer-0.5,   gstreamer-libs-0.5   and   gstreamer-play-0.5   using
   pkg-config.

   Our development currently focuses on the following items:
     * Increase stability and portability of scheduler
     * Add more video editing specific plugins
     * Improve plugins currently used by existing applications
     * Create language bindings

   We are starting to have a really nice collection of applications under
   development using GStreamer. If you are looking for something specific
   check out our [1]applications status page.

Support and Bugs

   We  use  [3]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback &> feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is  [4]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
