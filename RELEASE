                   GStreamer "Private Dancer" 0.5.0 released

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media  framework. This release has mainly focused
   on  code  clean-up  and  rounding out of the features. Large chunks of
   GStreamer are API stable at this point.

   This  is  a development release, in which we test several new features
   and  change  installs and break stuff ! Do not update unless you are a
   developer  or  willing to deal with issues that will crop up. You have
   been warned ;) 

   From  now  on,  GStreamer  will  follow a versioning scheme similar to
   kernel  and  GTK+/GLib  releases.  Odd  minor  numbers  (like for this
   release)  will be development releases. While GStreamer itself is very
   much  under development, during stable releases we will guarantee API-
   and  ABI-stability.  The point of this development release cycle is to
   support Gnome 2.1.x development.

   GStreamer     major-minor     series     versions    will    now    be
   parallel-installable.  Please  update  your  applications to check for
   gstreamer-0.5,   gstreamer-libs-0.5   and   gstreamer-play-0.5   using
   pkg-config.

   Our development currently focuses on the following items:
     * Increase stability and portability of scheduler
     * Add more video editing specific plugins
     * Improve plugins currently used by existing applications
     * Create language bindings

   We are starting to have a really nice collection of applications under
   development using GStreamer. If you are looking for something specific

Support and Bugs

   We  use  [3]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback &> feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is  [4]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
