                   GStreamer "GUADEC By Foot" 0.3.3 released

                           Preliminary release notes

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media  framework. This is our first release using
   GLib  2.0  and  libxml2  as  the  sole  compile platform. We have also
   started  including  all  our  documentation  in our RPMS starting this
   release.   People   wanting   to   build   GStreamer  themselves  with
   documentation should look at the DOCBUILDING file for some information
   on what packages are needed to build that successfully.

   Another new feature of this release is the gst-launch-ext command-line
   application.  It  uses  predefined  pipelines to play back media files
   based  on  their  file  extension.  This  means that you don't need to
   construct your own pipelines using gst-launch if all you want to do is
   play  a file. Just type gst-launch-ext [filename] and the audiofile or
   movie  plays  for  you.  This  of course also being a work in progress
   means  that  sometimes it might decide on the wrong pipeline, or cause
   jitter, as well as random headaches.

   For help building GStreamer, take a look at our [1]build help document
   .

   More  details on these features can be found on the project's website,
   [2]http://gstreamer.net/.   Source   tarballs  are  also  mirrored  at
   [3]http://gstreamer.net/releases/current/src/.  If you use Red Hat (or
   possibly  other  RPM-based  systems),  RPMs for both GStreamer itself,
   external  libraries and development tools not included in the standard
   reference    distribution    (RedHat    7.2)    can    be   found   in
   [4]http://gstreamer.net/releases/current/redhat.

   GStreamer  is  hosted on SourceForge, so support requests and bugs may
   be filed as usual. Interested developers of the core library, plugins,
   and  applications  should  subscribe  to  the gstreamer-devel list. If
   there is sufficient interest we will create more lists as necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
